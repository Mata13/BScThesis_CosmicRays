# BSc-Thesis: Study of Secondary Particle Flux Produced by Cosmic Rays

Welcome to the repository of my Bachelorâ€™s thesis in Earth Sciences. This project is focused on analyzing secondary particle flux generated by cosmic rays using simulation data. The thesis includes data processing, visualization, and a Beamer LaTeX slide for the thesis defense presentation.

---

> [!NOTE]
This repository contains data obtained from simulations using CORSIKA, run on a cluster. The purpose of the repository is to organize and present the analysis and results used in the thesis.

## Requirements

> [!TIP]
Before running the notebooks or scripts, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

How to Use:

Thesis Defense Slides: The /slides folder contains the LaTeX Beamer presentation used for my thesis defense. Compile it to PDF using pdflatex.

> [!IMPORTANT]
This repository only contains the processed data and analysis scripts. Raw simulation data obtained from CORSIKA runs is not included.
